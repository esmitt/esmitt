# Hello humans ðŸ‘½

Since 18 years ago, I started to code at University. Nowadays, I am working on Machine Learning approaches for medical imaging. I like to create, start and run IT-related projects, and spread the Computer Science knowledge. I always try it to stay up-to-date on my personal page ðŸ¤“

I am finishing my Ph.D. in the [Computer Vision Center - CVC](http://www.cvc.uab.es) at the [UaB](http://www.cvc.uab.es/) and got my MSc in Computer Science in the Computer Graphics Center -CCG at the [UCV](http://www.ucv.ve). I write code in different programming languages, frameworks, and libraries. Also, I love the humor in almost any sense, I hear/watch podcasts/series to learn, to laugh, and even while I'm cooking! ðŸ˜Ž.
