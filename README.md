# Hello humans ðŸ‘½

Since 17 years ago, I am writing code in different programming languages. Currently, I am working on Machine Learning approaches for medical imaging. I like to start and run developing-related projects, and I always try it to stay up-to-date on my personal page ðŸ¤“

I am finishing my Ph.D. in the [CVC](http://www.cvc.uab.es) at the [UaB](cvc.uab.es/). I coded different programming languages, frameworks and libraries. Also, I love the humor in almost any sense, I hear a lot of podcasts to work even to relax.
