# Hello humans ðŸ‘½

Since 17 years ago, I am writing code in different programming languages. Currently, I am working on Machine Learning approaches for medical imaging. I like to start and run developing-related projects, and I always try it to stay up-to-date on my personal page ðŸ¤“

I am finishing my Ph.D. in the [Computer Vision Center - CVC](http://www.cvc.uab.es) at the [UaB](http://www.cvc.uab.es/) and got my MSc in Computer Science in the Computer Graphics Center -CCG at the [UCV](http://www.ucv.ve) in Computer Graphics area. I coded different programming languages, frameworks, and libraries. Also, I love the humor in almost any sense, I hear a lot of podcasts to work even for relaxing ðŸ˜Ž.
