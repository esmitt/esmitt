# Hello humans

Since 17 years ago, I am writing code in different programming languages. Currently I am working on _Machine Learning_ approaches for medical imaging. I like running projects, for now I have a [personal page](https://esmittcode.me) where I try yo update the info.

I love the humor in almost any sense, I hear a lot of podcast to work even to relax. I am finishing my PhD into the [CVC] at the UaB(cvc.uab.es/). I have some running projects on social media: on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ecodedev), [Instagram](https://instagram.com/ecode.dev) or [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYsAE-Lv9qzAi0Rfoo_6ufw). Well, I have a lot of social networks: Reddit, Discord, Yotube and don't remember the others.
