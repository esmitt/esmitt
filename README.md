# Hello humans ðŸ‘½

Since 17 years ago, I am writing code in different programming languages. Currently, I am working on Machine Learning approaches for medical imaging. I like to start and run developing-related projects, and I always try it to stay up-to-date on my personal page ðŸ¤“

I love the humor in almost any sense, I hear a lot of podcasts to work even to relax. I am finishing my Ph.D. into the [CVC] at the UaB (cvc.uab.es/). I have some running projects on social media: on Twitter, Instagram, or Youtube. Well, I have a lot of social networks: Reddit, Discord, Youtube and don't remember the others.
